# LC3-ASM

A Package to provide syntax highlighting for [LC3](http://people.cs.georgetown.edu/~squier/Teaching/HardwareFundamentals/LC3-trunk/docs/README-LC3tools.html) .asm files in Sublime Text. 
  

### Cool Features

* "Goto Symbol" feature in Sublime Text will correspond to labels in the assembly code.

### Installation

* Open Sublime Text Command Pallete (Ctrl-Shift-P or Cmd-Shift-P) and search for `Package Control: Add Repository`.
* In the prompt, enter the github url of this repo and press ENTER. `https://github.com/aviaryan/lc3-sublime`
* Now open Command Pallete and search for `Package Control: Install Package`
* Install the package `lc3-sublime`
* All set !!


### Plans

* I would like to add a build system for lc3 assembly. However in Windows, the LC3Edit.exe (the assembler) doesn't seem to work from command-line. If you find a way, please help.
