# LC3-ASM

A Package to provide syntax highlighting for [LC3](http://people.cs.georgetown.edu/~squier/Teaching/HardwareFundamentals/LC3-trunk/docs/README-LC3tools.html) .asm files in Sublime Text.
  

### Cool Features

* "Goto Symbol" feature in Sublime Text will correspond to labels in the assembly code.

  
### Plans

* I would like to add a build system for lc3 assembly. However in Windows, the LC3Edit.exe (the assembler) doesn't seem to work from command-line. If you find a way, please help.
